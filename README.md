## Human Activity Recognition

In this project, we try to work on [Activity Recognition Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). This project was also used to explore the hyperopt (python module)for optimizing the hyperparameters of different models.

The Jupyter Notebook file is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Human-activity-recognition/blob/master/activity_recognition.ipynb) for this project.

The resources that helped me are:

+ [Hyperopt documentation](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt)
+ [Introduction to hyperopt](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introductory-example-of-bayesian-optimization-in-python-with-hyperopt-aae40fff4ff0)
+ [Parameter tuning with hyperopt](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/parameter-tuning-with-hyperopt)
